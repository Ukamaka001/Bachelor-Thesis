# Serverless Computing Models with WebAssembly (Wasm)

This repository contains my thesis project on **serverless computing models**, with a focus on **cost-efficient solutions using WebAssembly (Wasm)**.  
The work examines how Wasm can support lightweight, portable, and secure execution in serverless and edge environments.
