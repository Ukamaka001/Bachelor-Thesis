## Methods and Tools
- **Programming Languages:** Python, Rust, C++, AssemblyScript  
- **Environments:** Docker, OMNeT++, WASI, Unikernels  
- **Evaluation Focus:** Latency, cold-start performance, resource efficiency, cost analysis  

---

## Objectives
- Study the cost structure of serverless systems with WebAssembly  
- Compare WebAssembly, Docker, and Unikernels for lightweight deployment  
- Implement and test a **sensor–actuator scenario** using Wasm functions  
- Develop models and diagrams that capture workflows in a serverless context  

---

## Expected Outcomes
The project will deliver:
- Benchmarks on performance and cost  
- Comparative analysis of container and Wasm-based systems  
- Diagrams of architecture and workflows  
- A practical case study (sensor–actuator simulation)  

---
